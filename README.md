# Berkshire AP Coding Challenge

## Simple Vehicle API

This is a simple vehicle API that allows you to create, read, update and delete vehicles.

A video that shows how to setup the repository, how it works, and a quick walkthrough of the code is available at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG8d-I5Bhi0)

### Requirements

- [NodeJS >= 20](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) _(optional if you already have local Postgres)_

### Installation and database setup

- Clone this repository
- run `pnpm install`
- copy `.env copy` to `.env`
- update `.env` to your corresponding environment settings
- if using Docker, start docker: `docker compose up -d`
  - might take a while if your Docker hasn't downloaded Postgres image before
- once the DB/Docker is running, execute the DB migration files: `pnpm db:migrate`

### Running locally

To start the API endpoints, simply run:

`pnpm app:serve:dev`

### Prepopulating or Seeding Data

To load dummy data to the database, simply run:

`pnpm db:seed`

### Documentation

#### Open API Spec

A [OpenAPI specification document](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0) is automatically generated at: [http://localhost:11110/open-api](http://localhost:11110/open-api). You can import it to your favorite API Client, like Postman, Insomnia, etc.

#### Swagger UI

A more UI friendly documentation is served at [http://localhost:11110/docs](http://localhost:11110/docs) powered by [SwaggerHub UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/). It allows anyone to visualize and interact with the APIâ€™s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. In addition, this page can also serve as testing client if wanted.

### Testing

#### Via Swagger UI

The [docs](http://localhost:11110/docs) interactive docs allows you to test each endpoint from your browser. The endpoint specification, schema and parameters are defined in the document.

#### Via API Client

The [open-api page](http://localhost:11110/open-api) will generate a OpenAPI v3 Spec that you can import on your API client. Once imported, you can use your API client to do the testing.

#### Automated Testing

A end-to-end (e2e) testing system is also created to test all scenarios, including actual creation and deletion of Entities. View the [Spec file to see the test coverage](https://github.com/arvilmena/coding-challenge--berkshire-ap/blob/92fb50070cf7997f10583231eb4168d236cf8c8d/apps/berkshire-ap-coding-challenge-e2e/src/berkshire-ap-coding-challenge/berkshire-ap-coding-challenge.spec.ts). To run the e2e test just issue:

`pnpm test:e2e`

> :warning: **The E2E Test involves actual entity creation**: Your DB id will be incremented. All created entities shall be deleted at the end of E2E considering all the test passed.
